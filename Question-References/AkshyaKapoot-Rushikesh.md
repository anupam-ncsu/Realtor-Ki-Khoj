##### Q : How did you guys meet and how long do you know them for ?
> I met akshay through their agency. I contacted them when i moved here as student back in 2015. Have been in touchy since. Rented through him during college. Then rented a condo whehn i started working in downtown. Now brought  a house.

##### Q: How Long did it took to find the house ?
> I took us 15-20 houses. We went out 3-4 times and saw about 5 houses everytime. We were intially looking at burlington. But our bid didnt go through.
> 
##### Q: Did the Realtor negotiate ?
> There are no negotiations. But he really helps do the research on what you should give as the max limit for a particular property.

##### Q: Did he provide you with home inspection agent and a lawyer for the process?
> He does provide references. We didn't do the inspections as we had to put an unconditial offer. But the house was really well maintained. The owner had an excel sheet of everything eh has done and spend on the house since 2010. That made us confident.

##### Q: Positive?
> I have been in touch with him over the years. So he is quite frank. Again helps you look at things you could miss. Like with one house it had 3 bedroom but one bath. He warned us that it will be difficult when our parents move in. This is not something that a realtor know if he is not from a similar background or age group. He is not pushy. We dont have a car, so he took us around, that was helpful.

##### Q: What could have been better ?
> Do your own research. He will tell you the upper limit of a house. But it is entirely up to you to put down the bid or not. He is not pushy for sure. He gives you the space to make a decision. If it doesn't go through, it not his mistake.
