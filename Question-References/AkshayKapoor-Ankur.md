##### Q : How did you guys meet and how long do you know them for ?
> Connected with the brokerage firm on facebook. they hooked me with Akshay. Have been in touch with him for over a year. when we started talking, he knew we are not ready to buy.

##### Q: How Long did it took to find the house ?
> We looked at 17 houses. Took us close to 2 months. We put an offer in February 2020. Moved in April 2020

##### Q: Did the Realtor negotiate ?
> Market is not there to negotiate. But he does set your price expectations and an upper limit to make sure you make an informed decision. He is good when the seller go into a bidding round. He can get you an idea of what other are willing to give.

##### Q: Did he provide you with home inspection agent and a lawyer for the process?
> He will suggest you with his contacts. You can definitely find other if the price is too high. We went with his contact as the price other were giving were pretty close. Going with his contacts gives you the flexibility to talk to them through him. Even for mortgage agent, he did suggest a few, but you can find your own. 

##### Q: Positive?
> He is fair. He did not force us into making any decision. He has been with in touch for a long time even before we were sure to buy a house. Coming from the same country and having a similar age bracket helped us to gel easily. He tells you certain things that you might have not thought about. Thats good when you get a desi guy, you get that perspective which you might not get with a non-desi agent. Because you are hiring them for their expertise.
He seems to have a good grasp of the ares and the pocket to suggest what might work for you.

##### Q: What could have been better ?
> Very happy. Cant think of anything that could have gone better.
